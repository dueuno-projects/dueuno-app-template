Dueuno Application Template
===

[Dueuno Elements](https://github.com/dueuno-projects/dueuno-elements) is a framework built on top of the [Grails Framework](https://grails.org) to build Backoffice web applications (aka Internal Tools) with a single programming language: the amazing [Apache Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org).

Getting Started
---
You need Java Development Kit (JDK) 17 installed. We support only LTS Java releases.

1. Download the `dueuno-app-template` project from https://github.com/dueuno-projects/dueuno-app-template.
2. Run the application with `gradlew bootRun`
3. Login with `admin/admin` to manage the default tenant or with `super/super` to manage the whole application

If you want to create your own application starting from the template:
1. Find the text `myapplication` on all files and replace it with the name you want to give to your application
2. Rename all the folders called `myapplication` with the name you've chosen
